Your head pounds and your temples swell.
You can't remember what you were doing in this...forest.

Above you, ancient oak branches stretch out into a swaying canopy; their branches
mingle with the long bodies of the gangly stone pines next to them. 
You find yourself sprawled out in the dirt, lying against 
the trunk of a massive tree when suddenly from behind a thicket 20 feet
ahead, comes an old man...

| "Ciccia! Godsworn dog ran away from me again..." |
|--------------------------------------------------|

He catches sight of you...

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Host have you! You scared the bleedin' vapors out of me!"                |
| What madness brings you this far into the Holt without any weapons?"      |
